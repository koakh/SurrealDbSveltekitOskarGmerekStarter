## Requirements:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Ensure that ports `5173` and `8000` are available for use.

## Modern Stack:

- `SurrealDB` - The ultimate multi-model database
- `surrealdb.js` for interacting with awesome [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com)
- `sveltekit-superforms` + `zod` to enable super powers in working with forms - [Superforms](https://superforms.rocks/) | [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- `@master/css.svelte` as an interesting alternative for TailwindCSS - [MasterCSS](https://beta.css.master.co/docs/installation)
- `dayjs` to enable high level of DX in working with time and dates - [Day.js](https://day.js.org/)

## Setup Process:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies. For example:

```ts
bun install
```

If you don't have [bun](https://bun.sh) installed, you can utilize pnpm or any other Node.js package manager. For instance:

```
pnpm install
```

1. Execute the provided npm script. For example:

```ts
bun run multitaskum:developum
```

If you don't have [bun](https://bun.sh) installed, you can utilize pnpm or any other Node.js package manager. For instance:

```ts
pnpm run multitaskum:developum
```

This command will initiate SurrealDB within a Docker container and launch SvelteKit in your local development environment.

1. Access [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) using your preferred web browser.
2. Test various functionalities such as creating a new account, logging in, generating new posts, editing posts, and deleting them.

## Issues and Contributions:

- If you encounter any issues (as I rushed a bit to meet the hacktoberfest deadline), please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/oskar-gmerek/surreal-sveltekit/issues).
- I am open to any contributions as I aspire to make this starter a top choice for initiating projects that utilize the best modern technologies.
